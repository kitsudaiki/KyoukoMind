# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2019-08-19

### Added

- PoC-state:
    - this is basically the PoC-state with tcp-connection to ToriiGateway/KistuneClien/MiyuMonitoring
    - its primary to have a consistent tagged state which is linked against tagged versions of kitsune-repos
    - at the moment it can only learn simple outputs and is still really static
