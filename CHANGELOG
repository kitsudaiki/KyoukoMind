# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2021-03-29

### Added
- artificial cerebellum for better learing-output
- optional layered mode
- first automatic learning process (requires the layered mode at the moment)

### Changed
- fundamental rework of the data-structures for better performance and reduce memory consumption

### Removed
- GPU-Support is broken at the moment because of the rework (will be fixed in the next version)


## [0.2.0] - 2020-12-29

### Added
- first GPU-Support for 1 GPU with OpenCL
- new network-stack to connect to the new ToriiGateway, which provides client- and monitoring-connection

### Changed
- complete rework of the processing-structures to make the whole process faster with less memory consumption and compatible for the GPU-support
- improved the basic concept to reduce the number of created synapses and reduce some overwriting-problems in the output


## [0.1.0] - 2019-08-19

### Added
- PoC-state:
    - this is basically the PoC-state with tcp-connection to ToriiGateway/KistuneClien/MiyuMonitoring
    - its primary to have a consistent tagged state which is linked against tagged versions of kitsune-repos
    - at the moment it can only learn simple outputs and is still really static
